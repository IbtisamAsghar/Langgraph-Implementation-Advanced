            "Summary: Andrew Yan-Tak Ng (Chinese: 吳恩達; born April 18, 1976) is a British-American computer scientist and technology entrepreneur focusing on machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI). Ng was a cofounder and head of Google Brain and was the former Chief Scientist at Baidu, building the company's Artificial Intelligence Group into a team of several thousand people.\n",
            "Ng is an adjunct professor at Stanford University (formerly associate professor and Director of its Stanford AI Lab or SAIL). Ng has also worked in the field of online education, cofounding Coursera and DeepLearning.AI. He has spearheaded many efforts to \"democratize deep learning\" teaching over 8 million students through his online courses. Ng is renowned globally in computer science, recognized in Time magazine's 100 Most Influential People in 2012 and Fast Company's Most Creative People in 2014. His influence extends to being named in the Time100 AI Most Influential People in 2023.\n",
            "In 2018, he launched and currently heads the AI Fund, initially a $175-million investment fund for backing artificial intelligence startups. He has founded Landing AI, which provides AI-powered SaaS products.\n",
            "On April 11, 2024, Amazon announced the appointment of Ng to its board of directors.\n",

            "Summary: Vibe coding is an artificial intelligence-assisted software development style popularized by Andrej Karpathy in February 2025.  The term was listed in the Merriam-Webster Dictionary the following month as a \"slang & trending\" term.\n",
            "It describes a chatbot-based approach to creating software where the developer describes a project or task to a large language model (LLM), which generates code based on the prompt. The developer evaluates the result and asks the LLM for improvements. Unlike traditional AI-assisted coding or pair programming, the human developer avoids micromanaging the code, accepts AI-suggested completions liberally, and focuses more on iterative experimentation than code correctness or structure.\n",
            "Karpathy described it as \"fully giving in to the vibes, embracing exponentials, and forgetting that the code even exists\". He used the method to build prototypes like MenuGen, letting LLMs generate all code, while he provided goals, examples, and feedback via natural language instructions. The programmer shifts from manual coding to guiding, testing, and giving feedback about the AI-generated source code.\n",
            "Advocates of vibe coding say that it allows even amateur programmers to produce software without the extensive training and skills required for software engineering. Critics point out a lack of accountability, maintainability and increased risk of introducing security vulnerabilities in the resulting software.\n",
